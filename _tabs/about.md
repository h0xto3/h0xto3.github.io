Your friendly neighbourhood jester dabbling in a bit of hacking, old chap. I have a profound fondness for delving into the world of Cyber Security and Hacking. Ever since I was a nipper, I've been engrossed in playing video games on the good old PC. I even picked up the knack for assembling PCs, so I've always been rather pally with them. Not to forget, I hold quite an affection for the Payday Franchise and, in particular, for Hoxton, as you might have already gleaned.

My passion took root five years ago when I embarked on my journey with my very first programming language. Since then, I've been wholeheartedly keen on expanding my knowledge about Computers and Networks, and how to give them a bit of a nudge, if you catch my drift. Over the last couple of years, I've been dedicating more of my leisure hours to CTF Challenges. At the outset, it was quite the puzzle for me to crack those challenges (and truth be told, it still remains a head-scratcher to this day). I've found meticulously crafted Walkthroughs to be jolly helpful, and thus, I wish to offer something back to the community by penning my very own Walkthroughs, in the hopes that they might lend a hand to a few chaps and chapettes out there.
